# Evaluating Cloud-native Deployment Options with a Focus on Reliability Aspects

This repository contains the deployment of a microservice application with a focus on the reliability aspects for cloud-native applications defined by Lichtenthäler and Wirtz ([Paper,](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-04718-3_7) [Model](https://r0light.github.io/cna-quality-model/)). 


## Cloud-native Deployment

The product factors of the quality aspect *Reliability* from the cloud-native quality model by Lichtenthäler and Wirtz were implemented using the microservice reference application [Teastore](https://github.com/DescartesResearch/TeaStore).  
The [baseline architecture](https://github.com/frankakn/reliability-deployment/tree/main/Deployment/BaselineArchitecture) of the cloud-native application deployment was implemented using AWS EKS.  
In addition, the implementation options for each product factor were added in a modular manner to complement the baseline architecture.  
The repository is structured as follows: Each directory of a product factor contains the options and solutions that contribute to the implementation of the reliability aspect. Corresponding implementation instructions are provided, as well as corresponding changes to the workload definition of the TeaStore.  
 
The following table shows a summary of implemented concepts. 

| Product Factor                       | Implementation Options              |                                 |                                   |                                 |                         |
